# Form Validation Project

This project is a simple HTML form with client-side validation using JavaScript. It demonstrates how to validate form fields such as name, age, gender, phone number, qualification, email, and message before submission.

## Features

- Real-time client-side validation for:
  - Name (required, minimum 3 characters)
  - Age (required, positive number)
  - Gender (required selection)
  - Phone Number (required, exactly 10 digits)
  - Qualification (required)
  - Email (required, valid format)
  - Message (required, minimum 10 characters)
- User-friendly error messages
- Form reset on successful submission


##  How Validation Works

The validation logic is located in `validation.js` and is triggered on form submission:

- Prevents default form submission.
- Validates each field according to defined rules.
- Displays inline error messages.
- On successful validation, logs form data and shows a success alert.
